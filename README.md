# Webcam Face Masker

This application applies a facial mask to any faces captured by the webcam. 
In addition, it includes a "Save snapshot" feature that captures the current frame and saves it as a JPEG file.

This was developed during my free time as a hobby project.
There are some limitations in version 1.0 that I am still trying to overcome, especially the "laggy" frame rate.
On top of that, I'm planning on packaging the app and distribute it with an installer.
